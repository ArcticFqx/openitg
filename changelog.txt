-Barebones work on tournament mode (it's still a while away)
-Input changes:
    Newer, more ITG-like input debouncing (half-working...)
    "Select" or "MenuLeft+MenuRight" cancels custom song loading
    Linux joystick driver is now threaded (and supports DebugUSBInput)
    X11 input code backported from 4.0
-New LUA functions:
    IsUsingMemoryCard(PlayerNumber) - self-explanatory
    Debug() - output debugging lines regardless of log settings

    StepsUtil::RemoveStepsOutsideMeterRange()
    StepsUtil::RemoveStepsOutsideDifficultyRange()
    Song::HasStepsWithinMeterRange()
-New messages:
    "CardReadyP1", "CardReadyP2" - played when a card is verified ready
-New preferences:
    "SoundVolumeAttract" - volume during attract sequences
    "TextEntryUsesArcadeInput" - use arcade-specialised input scheme for ScreenTextEntry
    "ThreadedLights" - run the lights outside the regular game loop, more accurate
    "UseUnstablePIUIODriver" - set true to use the experimental I/O driver
