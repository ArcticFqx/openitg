Core engine stuff
-----------------
- Implement/test Ridiculous timing logic
  (note to self: make sure there are at least 3 inputs in the window)
- Clean up horrendous custom song logic in SongManager

DiagnosticsUtil
---------------
- Figure out why GetNumMachineScores is returning values that are too low

UserPackManager
---------------
- Test disk space limiting (i.e. reject packs that are too big for the disk)
- Implement/test ETA reports for completion of pack transfer

Autotools (Linux)
-----------------
- Add an option to compile ffmpeg statically
    - Add ffmpeg's source to SVN and compile it in place
- Compile against glibc 2.3.2 on ITG_ARCADE (what is this I don't even...)

Pipe dreams
-----------
- Figure out a nice way to handle remounting itgdata on ITG_ARCADE
- Compile a USB 2.0 kernel module for ITG's kernel
    - Selectively load it for custom song reading and pack management
